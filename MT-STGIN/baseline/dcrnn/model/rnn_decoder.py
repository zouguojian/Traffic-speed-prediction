  """RNN decoder for the sequence-to-sequence model.

  Args:
    decoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x input_size].
    initial_state: 2D Tensor with shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
    loop_function: If not None, this function will be applied to the i-th output
      in order to generate the i+1-st input, and decoder_inputs will be ignored,
      except for the first element ("GO" symbol). This can be used for decoding,
      but also for training to emulate http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099.
      Signature -- loop_function(prev, i) = next
        * prev is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x output_size],
        * i is an integer, the step number (when advanced control is needed),
        * next is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x input_size].
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn_decoder".

  Returns:
    A tuple of the form (outputs, state), where:
      outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors with
        shape [batch_size x output_size] containing generated outputs.
      state: The state of each cell at the final time-step.
        It is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
        (Note that in some cases, like basic RNN cell or GRU cell, outputs and
         states can be the same. They are different for LSTM cells though.)
