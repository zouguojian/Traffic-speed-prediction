## MODEL ITEM
### 1. Multi-Task-Based Spatiotemporal Generative Inference Network: A Novel Framework for Predicting the Highway Traffic Speed (MT-STGIN) [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/MT-STGIN)  
* Note that, for the MT-STGIN program, it should be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1. 
If not, there are some problems will appear in the running stage.
* For me, I encountered the problem that is "could not initialize a memory primitive descriptor"
 when the TensorFlow version == 1.12.0.

### 2. Speed prediction of spatio-temporal attention network for dynamic highway network (ST-ANet) [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/ST-ANet)  
* This program has been accepted by journal of Computer Engineering. Therefore, you can download the codes on your
computer device, and use it as your component of research or subject.

### 3. How to Accurately Predict Traffic Speed Using Simple Input Variables? A Novel Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Bilateral Learning Network (3S-TBLN) [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/3S-TBLN)  
* Note that, 3S-TBLN can be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1, even the version >2.0.0. Then, we will upload all baselines' codes in this page.
