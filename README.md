## MODEL ITEM
### 1. MT-STGIN [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/MT-STGIN)
>Multi-Task-Based Spatiotemporal Generative Inference Network: A Novel Framework for Predicting the Highway Traffic Speed

* Note that, for the MT-STGIN program, it should be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1. 
If not, there are some problems will appear in the running stage.
* For me, I encountered the problem that is "could not initialize a memory primitive descriptor"
 when the TensorFlow version == 1.12.0.

### 2. ST-ANet [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/ST-ANet)
>Spatiotemporal Attention Learning Network
* This program has been accepted by journal of Computer Engineering, So, you can download the codes on your
computer, and use it as your component of research or subject.

### 3. RST-Net [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-speed-prediction/tree/main/RST-Net)
>Spatiotemporal Encoder-Decoder Neural Network


MT-STGIN has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems TITS journal;
