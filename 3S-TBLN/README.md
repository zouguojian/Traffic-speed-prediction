# Traffic-speed-prediction

## WHAT SHOULD WE PAY ATTENTION TO FOCUS ON THE RUNNING ENVIRONMENT?

<font face="微软雅黑" >Note that we need to install the right packages to guarantee the model runs according to the file requirements.txt！！！</font>
  
>* first, please use the conda tool to create a virtual environment, such as ‘conda create traffic speed’;  
> * second, active the environment, and conda activate traffic speed;   
> * third, build environment, the required environments have been added in the file named requirements.txt; you can use conda as an auxiliary tool to install or pip, e.g., conda install tensorflow==1.13.1;    
> * if you have installed the last TensorFlow version, it’s okay; import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf and tf.disable_v2_behavior();    
> * finally, please click the run_train.py file; the codes are then running;  
> * Note that our TensorFlow version is 1.14.1 and can also be operated on the 2.0. version.
