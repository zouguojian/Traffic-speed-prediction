# Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Forecasting

This folder concludes the code and data of our AGCRN model: [Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02842.pdf).

## Structure:

* data: including PEMSD4 and PEMSD8 dataset used in our experiments, which are released by and available at  [ASTGCN](https://github.com/Davidham3/ASTGCN/tree/master/data).

* lib: contains self-defined modules for our work, such as data loading, data pre-process, normalization, and evaluate metrics.

* model: implementation of our AGCRN model


## Requirements

Python 3.6.5, Pytorch 1.1.0, Numpy 1.16.3, argparse and configparser
